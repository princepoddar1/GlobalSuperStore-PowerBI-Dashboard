# Global Superstore Power BI Dashboard

This project is a **Power BI dashboard** created using the Global Superstore dataset (2016‚Äì2019).  
It was developed as a learning project to understand how real-world business problems are analyzed and visualized using Power BI.

## üìò Project Overview

Global Super Store, a large retail company, initially used Excel for data analysis.  
To gain deeper business insights, they decided to move to Power BI for better visualization and analytics.  

This dashboard demonstrates how Power BI can help businesses:
- Track key performance metrics (Sales, Profit, Orders, and Customers)
- Identify sales trends over time
- Compare performance across regions and product categories
- Analyze seasonality and profitability

## üéØ Business Problems Solved

1. **Performance Summary:**  
   Visuals showing total revenue, total profit, total orders, and total customers help assess the company's overall performance.

2. **Yearly Trends:**  
   Line and bar charts visualize year-wise sales and profit, helping management see how performance evolved over time.

3. **Monthly Seasonality:**  
   Month-by-month sales and profit visuals highlight seasonal sales trends and identify months of high or low performance.

4. **Regional Insights:**  
   Charts comparing different markets (APAC, EU, US, LATAM, etc.) show which regions generate the most sales and profit.

5. **Quarterly Planning:**  
   A quarterly sales breakdown supports strategic business planning.

6. **Dynamic Filtering:**  
   Slicers for category and segment allow users to interactively filter all visuals to view specific data segments.

## üß© Additional Enhancements

To simulate real-world business scenarios, extra requirements were implemented:

- **Fixed KPI Cards:**  
  Added fixed total values for Sales and Profit that remain unchanged during slicer interactions.

- **Target Analysis:**  
  The dashboard includes visuals comparing actual performance against the company‚Äôs set targets  
  (Sales goal: $25M by 2020 and Profit goal: $10M).

- **Reset Button:**  
  A button was created to reset all filters/slicers with one click for a smooth user experience.

- **Geo Map Visualization:**  
  Used maps to analyze country-wise performance.  
  - Profit map: Gradient color scale from Red (low) to Green (high).  
  - Sales map:  
    - <80K ‚Üí Dark Red  
    - 80K‚Äì200K ‚Üí Red  
    - 200K‚Äì700K ‚Üí Green  
    - >700K ‚Üí Golden

- **Segment & Region Visuals:**  
  Added visuals to compare product segments, regions, and their percentage contributions.
